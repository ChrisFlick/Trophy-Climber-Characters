Shadows rendered with hard-edged geometric tone blocks

Feather textures simplified into grouped geometric planes — no soft detailing

Consistent with the visual language of prestige comic realism

🧠 Role & Design Constraints
Character role: Solo character, comic relief

Not anthropomorphized — rendered as a real bird within the ink art style
