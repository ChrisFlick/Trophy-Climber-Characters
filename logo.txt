🖌️ Shirt Logo — Full Prompt Lock
🔰 Design Description
A sword crossed with a paintbrush, forming a stylized “X”

The sword must:

Be diagonally oriented, pointing upward-right

Have a wide blade tapering to a sharp point

Include a U-shaped curved crossguard with tapered ends

Feature a center block at the intersection (lime green square)

Use a solid black grip/handle, clearly separated from the guard

The paintbrush must:

Be diagonally oriented, pointing upward-left

Have a leaf-shaped bristle — not feathered, no fraying

Include a rectilinear shaft with two visible handle bands

Handle thickness must match sword's visual weight

🎨 Color Lock — Channel-Compatible Palette
Fill color: #A2D729 (Lime-Green Yellow variant)

Outline/stroke: #333333 (Charcoal Black)

Color enforcement rules:

No hue shifts, gradients, desaturation, or substitutions

Maintain high contrast against shirt background (#73778E)

Colors must appear matte — no gloss, no lighting effects

🧱 Geometry Lock — Vector Fidelity
Must follow the vector structure from reference image:

Symmetry and proportion must be preserved:

Sword tip and brush tip must not be cropped or hidden

Crossguard and paintbrush bands must remain visible and intact

Center lime-green block must remain centered and square

No geometric distortion, warping, or alignment drift

🔒 Pose-Resistant Geometry Lock (v4)
This ensures the logo remains readable and fully intact regardless of character pose, arm movement, or shirt curvature.

Sword and brush must remain clearly visible even when shirt is stretched or angled

No compression or skewing of internal elements

Logo must scale and align correctly with shirt shape

Center alignment on the chest is mandatory — never offset

Logo should always include full tip of sword and brush, crossguard, lime-green center block, and brush bands

🧱 Positioning Lock
Logo must appear:

Centered on the chest of the shirt

Scaled proportionally to fit cleanly within shirt bounds

Never tilted, rotated, shrunk, enlarged, or misaligned

Must always contrast visibly with shirt color #73778E

💠 Usage Notes
This logo is currently worn by the Child Character v4

It integrates into all standing, neutral, and expressive poses

Additional poses (e.g., flexing, pointing, Leonardo meme) must preserve logo geometry and visibility
